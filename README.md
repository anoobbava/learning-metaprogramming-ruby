learning-metaprogramming-ruby
-----------------------------

This repository is a collection of annotations and snippets that go along with 
each chapter ("day") of the book Metaprogramming Ruby by Paolo Perrotta. Aside 
from trivially narrow snippets ("abc".class), I have generally tried to avoid 
plagiarism and provide my own versions of the ideas presented in the book. In 
some cases I have enhanced the examples where it seemed appropriate. 

Annotations that were the result of Ruby execution were produced using 
xmpfilter, which is part of the rcodetools gem. xmpfilter has vim and emacs 
bindings, and the popular rubytapas.com video series by Avdi Grimm can be 
viewed for a demonstration of xmpfilter in action.
